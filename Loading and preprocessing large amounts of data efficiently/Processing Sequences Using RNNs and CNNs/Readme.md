# Processing Sequences with RNNs and CNNs

This chapter explores how **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** can process sequences and predict future patterns in time series data. RNNs excel at handling sequences of arbitrary lengths, making them useful for tasks such as time series forecasting and natural language processing (NLP) applications like automatic translation and speech-to-text.

## Key Topics

### RNN Fundamentals
- RNNs analyze sequential data, such as:
  - Daily active users on a website.
  - Hourly temperatures.
  - Home power consumption.
  - Vehicle trajectories.
- They learn patterns from past data to forecast future trends, assuming patterns persist.

### Applications of RNNs
- **Time Series Forecasting**
- **Sentence and Document Processing**
- **Audio Analysis**

### Training RNNs
- RNNs are trained using **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**.
- They are compared to traditional models like **ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average)** to measure performance.

### Challenges and Solutions
#### Unstable Gradients
- Techniques to stabilize training:
  - **Recurrent Dropout**
  - **Layer Normalization**

#### Limited Memory
- Memory extended using advanced architectures:
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells**
  - **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) cells**

### Alternative Approaches
- **Dense Networks**: Work well for small sequences.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Handle very long sequences effectively (e.g., audio samples, text).

### WaveNet
- A **CNN architecture** designed for processing long sequences.
- Capable of handling tens of thousands of time steps.

- # Recurrent Neurons and Layers

This section provides an overview of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), highlighting their ability to handle sequential data by maintaining memory through recurrent connections.

## Key Concepts

- **Recurrent Connections**: Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs include loopback connections, enabling the network to remember previous inputs.
- **Unrolling Through Time**: RNNs are visualized over multiple time steps, where each neuron processes both the current input and the previous time step's output.

## Mathematical Representation

### Single Recurrent Neuron
The output of a single recurrent neuron at time step `t` is computed as:

 The output of a single recurrent neuron at time step `t` is computed as:

$$
\hat{y}(t) = \phi(W_x^T x(t) + W_y^T \hat{y}(t-1) + b)
$$

Where:
- \( x(t) \): Input vector at time \( t \).
- \( \hat{y}(t) \): Output at time \( t \).
- \( W_x, W_y \): Weight matrices for the inputs and previous outputs, respectively.
- \( b \): Bias vector.
- \( \phi \): Activation function (e.g., ReLU).

- **x(t)**: Input vector at time `t`.
- **ŷ(t)**: Output at time `t`.
- **Wₓ, Wᵧ**: Weight matrices for the inputs and previous outputs, respectively.
- **b**: Bias vector.
- **ϕ**: Activation function (e.g., ReLU).
- The output of a single recurrent neuron at time step `t` is computed as:

ŷ(t) = ϕ(Wₓᵀ x(t) + Wᵧᵀ ŷ(t-1) + b)

Where:
- x(t): Input vector at time t.
- ŷ(t): Output at time t.
- Wₓ, Wᵧ: Weight matrices for the inputs and previous outputs, respectively.
- b: Bias vector.
- ϕ: Activation function (e.g., ReLU).


### Batch Processing
For a mini-batch, the outputs for all instances are computed as:

 
- **X(t)**: Input matrix for all instances at time `t`.
- **Ŷ(t)**: Output matrix for all instances at time `t`.

## Memory Cells

- **State Preservation**: A recurrent neuron or layer acts as a memory cell, maintaining state across time steps.
- **Learning Dependencies**:
  - **Basic Cells**: Short-term patterns (e.g., ~10 steps).
  - **Advanced Cells**: Long-term patterns using LSTM or GRU.

## Input and Output Sequences

RNNs can handle various configurations of input and output sequences:

### Sequence-to-Sequence
- **Input**: Sequence of `N` time steps.
- **Output**: Corresponding sequence shifted by one time step.
- **Example**: Predict daily power consumption for the next day.

### Sequence-to-Vector
- **Input**: Sequence of time steps.
- **Output**: Single value.
- **Example**: Sentiment analysis of a movie review.

### Vector-to-Sequence
- **Input**: Single vector repeated across time steps.
- **Output**: Sequence of values.
- **Example**: Generating a caption for an image.

### Encoder-Decoder
- **Structure**: Combines a sequence-to-vector encoder with a vector-to-sequence decoder.
- **Example**: Machine translation, where:
  - The encoder represents a sentence as a single vector.
  - The decoder generates the translated sentence.

## Advantages of Encoder-Decoder Architecture

- **Full Context**: Captures the complete context of input sequences before generating output.
- **Effectiveness**: Outperforms direct sequence-to-sequence RNNs for tasks where later inputs affect earlier outputs.
