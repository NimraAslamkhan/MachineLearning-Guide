1 What machine learning is, what problems it tries to solve, and the main
categories and fundamental concepts of its systems
2 The steps in a typical machine learning project
3 Learning by fitting a model to data
4 Optimizing a cost function
5 Handling, cleaning, and preparing data
6 Selecting and engineering features
7 Selecting a model and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation
8 The challenges of machine learning, in particular underfitting and
9 overfitting (the bias/variance trade-off)
10 The most common learning algorithms: linear and polynomial
regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector
machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods
11  Reducing the dimensionality of the training data to fight the “curse of
dimensionality”
12 Other unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, density
estimation, and anomaly detection
