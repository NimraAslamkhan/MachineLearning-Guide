# Natural Language Processing with RNNs

The goal of NLP research is to build machines that master language, though it typically focuses on specific tasks like text classification, translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis.

The passage outlines an exploration of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in NLP, starting with:

Char-RNNs: Predicting the next character to generate text, using stateless and stateful RNNs.
Word-level RNNs: Performing tasks like sentiment analysis.
Encoder-decoder architectures: For neural machine translation (e.g., English to Spanish).
It then introduces attention mechanisms, which help models focus on relevant input parts, enhancing RNN-based architectures. Finally, it transitions to transformers, attention-only models like GPT and BERT, which have revolutionized NLP. The chapter concludes by exploring Hugging Face's Transformers library and demonstrating a Shakespeare-style text generation model.

## Generating Shakespearean Text with a Character RNN
Andrej Karpathy demonstrated that a character RNN (char-RNN) could generate text by predicting the next character in a sequence. This approach is applied to Shakespeare's works, training an RNN to learn patterns in text. The process involves creating a dataset of text sequences, building a model with an embedding layer and GRU, training it to predict the next character, and generating text that mimics Shakespeare's style.

Hereâ€™s the corrected and well-organized code for creating, training, and using a character RNN to generate Shakespearean text.
