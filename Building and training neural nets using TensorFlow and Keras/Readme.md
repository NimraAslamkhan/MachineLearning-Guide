# Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow

## Introduction to TensorFlow
TensorFlow is a powerful library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited for large-scale machine learning tasks. It offers high-level APIs for simplicity and lower-level APIs for fine control.

### High-Level API
Keras is sufficient for 95% of use cases, enabling tasks like:
- Regression and classification.
- Wide & Deep networks and self-normalizing networks.
- Techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and learning rate schedules.

### Lower-Level API
Provides finer control for tasks like:
- Custom loss functions, metrics, layers, models, initializers, and regularizers.
- Custom training loops for advanced gradient transformations or multi-optimizer networks.
- Boosting models using TensorFlow’s automatic graph generation.

# Using TensorFlow: A Summary

## Tensors and Operations

### Tensors
Tensors are multidimensional arrays, similar to NumPy's `ndarray`. They can hold scalars or higher-dimensional data and are created using `tf.constant()`.

Example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

t = tf.constant([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]])
print(t.shape)  # TensorShape([2, 3])
print(t.dtype)  # tf.float32
```
Operations
TensorFlow supports basic and advanced operations, such as addition, multiplication, and matrix operations.
```python
tf.square(t), t + 10, t @ tf.transpose(t)
```
Interoperability
Tensors in TensorFlow integrate seamlessly with NumPy, allowing conversions and shared operations.

Key Differences with NumPy
Type Conversions: TensorFlow avoids automatic type conversions to optimize performance.
Function Names: TensorFlow functions (e.g., tf.reduce_mean) often differ from NumPy for GPU optimization.
Transposing: Using tf.transpose() creates a new tensor, unlike NumPy's t.T, which creates a view.
Variables
tf.Variable represents mutable tensors often used as model parameters.
```python
v = tf.Variable([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
v.assign(2 * v)
v[0, 1].assign(42)
```
Data Structures in TensorFlow
Sparse Tensors
tf.SparseTensor: Efficiently represents mostly zero tensors.
Tensor Arrays
tf.TensorArray: Lists of tensors with fixed or extensible lengths.
Ragged Tensors
tf.RaggedTensor: Handles tensors with varying sizes along specified dimensions.
String Tensors
Represent byte strings, such as UTF-8 encoded text.
Sets
Represented as regular or sparse tensors. Operations are available via tf.sets.
Queues
Manage tensors across steps, supporting FIFO, priority, and random shuffling.
Execution and Customization
TensorFlow provides flexibility through customization:

Custom Loss Functions: Define tailored loss calculations.
Custom Metrics: Implement unique evaluation measures.
Custom Layers: Create specialized network layers.
Custom Training Loops: Optimize training with advanced strategies, such as multi-optimizer networks.
Performance and Compatibility
TensorFlow ensures compatibility across CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, leveraging efficient device-specific kernels.
Supports multiple programming languages (Python, C++, Java) and platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android).
Best Practices
Use explicit type casting with tf.cast when combining tensors of different data types.
Leverage TensorFlow’s structured modules (tf.sparse, tf.ragged, tf.queue) for specialized use cases.
Familiarize yourself with TensorFlow's unique methods, as it doesn't always mimic NumPy's behavior.
## Custom Loss Functions

### Scenario
When training a regression model with noisy data:
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Penalizes large errors heavily, reducing precision.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Converges slowly and may result in imprecision.
- **Huber Loss**: Balances between MSE and MAE. Ideal for noisy datasets.

# Custom Losses, Metrics, and Gradients in TensorFlow

This guide explores how to implement custom losses, metrics, and gradients in TensorFlow, including handling model internals and numerical stability.

---

## Custom Losses and Metrics Based on Model Internals

### Use Case
Define losses and metrics based on model internals, such as hidden layer activations or weights, for tasks like regularization or monitoring.

### Implementation
- **Add a custom loss:** Use `model.add_loss()`.
- **Track a custom metric:** Use `model.add_metric()`.

### Example: Regression Model with Auxiliary Outputs
```python
import tensorflow as tf
```
# Define a sample model
```python
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
hidden = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation="relu")(inputs)
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(hidden)
```

# Auxiliary output loss (e.g., reconstruction loss)
```python
reconstruction_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(hidden))
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
```
# Add custom loss
```python
model.add_loss(0.01 * reconstruction_loss)
```
# Add custom metric for monitoring
```python
model.add_metric(reconstruction_loss, name="reconstruction_loss", aggregation="mean")
```
# Compile and train
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse", metrics=["mae"])
model.fit(tf.random.normal((100, 10)), tf.random.normal((100, 1)), epochs=5)
Tips for Numerical Stability
Use tf.add_n() to sum multiple tensors for improved precision.
Apply gradient clipping using clipnorm or clipvalue to avoid exploding gradients.
Use tf.reduce_mean() or similar functions cautiously to avoid vanishing or exploding losses.
